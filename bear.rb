  # refactoring eat_fish?
  # 1.  Bear tells river to remove a fish from its fish stock.
  # instead of river.contents.delete(taken)
  # river.remove_fish(taken)
  # add method to river instead of bear....

  # 2. Bear tells river to provide a random fish to catch.
  # instead of taken = river.contents.sample
  # taken = river.sample_contents
